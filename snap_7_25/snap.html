<p>5 types of branching in Git Flow:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Master Branch: Default branch that stores the official release history of the project.</li>
			<li>Develop Branch: This branch stores a complete history of the project, where Master stores an abridged version.</li>
			<li>Feature Branch: Feature branches use develop as their parent branch. When completed the feature is merged back into develop.</li>
			<li>Release Branch: Release branches are forked off the develop branch once develop has acquired enough features for a release. Creating this branch starts the release cycle.</li>
			<li>Hotfix Branch: Maintence or "hotfix" branches are used to quickly patch a production release. A Hotfix branch is based on Master rather than develop.</li>
		</ul>
